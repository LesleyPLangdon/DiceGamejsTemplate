# Instructions

You will create a simple dice game where the player and the computer roll a pair of dice to see who wins each round based on the highest total. This project introduces functions, events, and basic DOM manipulation for displaying results on the screen. 

## Plan

### Objective
Define the purpose of the dice game.

### Features
- Players and computer each roll two dice.
- The game determines the winner based on the higher dice total.
- Display the current roll and cumulative score.

### Requirements
- Use functions to handle the dice roll.
- Use `Math.random()` to generate dice values.
- Display roll results and scores on the page.
- Use a button to start each new roll.

### Breakdown Requirements

1. **Determine necessary variables**:  
   List variables and describe their content.

2. **Decide on basic HTML structure**:
   - Header: name of the game, student name
   - Main Section:  
     - Paragraph (P): explain game rules
   - Footer: copyright

3. **User Interactions**:
   - How will we roll the dice?

### Design

#### HTML Structure
What elements do you need?  
Write pseudo code for HTML layout:
- Example (use as a starting point; add sections for gameplay):
  - **Header**: Name of game, student name
  - **Main**:
    - **Section**:
      - P: Explain game
  - **Footer**: Copyright

#### Visual Layout
Keep it simple. Attach a wireframe.

## Function Design

Write pseudo code for each of the following functions:
1. `rollDice()`: Generates random dice rolls.
2. `calculateScore()`: Calculates the result and updates the score.
3. `displayResults()`: Updates the HTML to show the current roll and scores.

## Implement
- Write your code
- Donâ€™t forget descriptive comments

## Test

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each function (e.g., `rollDice()`, `playRound()`, `displayResults()`) individually.
2. **Gameplay Testing**: Verify that rolls are random, results display correctly, and scores update accurately.
3. **Edge Cases**: Test scenarios like ties and re-rolling to ensure consistent results.
